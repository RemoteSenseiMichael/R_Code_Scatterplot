# R Code: Scatterplot

This code, writtin in the R programming language, is for creating a scatterplot using the ggplot2 library in R. 

In the example here, a scatterplot is created showing the predicted/modelled active layer thickness (ALT) depth using a Google Earth Engine (GEE) approach, versus airborne measured ALT.
